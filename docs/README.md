# My-Portfolio
This is an E-Portfolio created to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. You can find my deployed portfolio at this [link](https://cindybsydney.github.io/My-Portfolio/)

## Features
1. This portfolio has sections showing the following
    - Skills
    - Work Experience
    - Projects

2. The design of the portfolio is responsive to optimize the viewing on different screen sizes.
3. For smaller screen sizes, the navbar functionality enables it to morph into a menu icon. This is achieved using Vanilla JS.
